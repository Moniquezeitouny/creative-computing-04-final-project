                In a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits.

In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.               </span>
